"""Gate: the bootstrap pins, the two installers and the workspace's declared platforms all
say the same thing.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Bootstrapping is the step that cannot be done by the tools it installs, so
the pins live in a text table rather than in a lockfile. A table is a second place, and a
second place drifts: an installer grows an architecture arm whose row was never added, a
release is re-pinned and the checksum copied from the wrong line, or a project declares
`osx-arm64` in its `pixi.toml` while nothing here can install pixi on it. None of those is
visible until somebody is standing at a bare machine.

ORDER, AND THE ONE LINK NO PIN COVERS. `repo` comes first and `pixi` second, because the
pins live inside the manifest repository and only `repo init` puts that on disk. So the
launcher that performed the first fetch was itself unpinned; `install.sh` re-fetches it at
the pinned version, verifies it, and says so when the launcher already on PATH differs.
Moving pixi first would not close the circle, only relocate it.

Five pairs are walked, each enumerated rather than sampled -- every population here is a
handful of lines in files this repository owns.

  1. every architecture arm in an installer resolves to a pixi row
  2. every pixi row is reachable from at least one installer arm
  3. every platform any workspace `pixi.toml` declares has a pixi row
  4. every pinned pixi checksum matches what the release publishes
  5. the pinned repo launcher matches what its source serves
  6. every script the readme's one-step command names exists here

The last two need the network. They are not skipped when it is absent, because a silent skip
reads exactly like a pass; `--offline` drops them and still exits non-zero, naming them.
